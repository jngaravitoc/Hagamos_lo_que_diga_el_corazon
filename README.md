# Hagamos_lo_que_diga_el_corazon
Sciense hack day project for a low cost ECG using Arduino and python for real time heart beat visualization.
The matirial needed for this, is: An Arduino, some leds, 1k resitences and a computer with Unix. This project can be brokedown in two stages: First become your computer an ossiloscope, Second amplifie and clean the heart beat signal.  

# Convert your computer an ossiloscope

metrials: arduino, camputer, temperature sensor(LM35 ot tmp36), 1 LED, protoboard and 1kOhm resistance.
